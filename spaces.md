### Welcome to spaces, here Algebra Introducing the free spaces to organise meetings online in opensource.

The open source community is diverse and highly motivated. We're sure you'll be able to find someone who can help you (or that you can help) no matter what your interests are.
Whether it's development or advocacy, open source software and other collaborative projects benefit through, and because of, community. Unlike traditional projects that require physical resources, sharing economies are generally only hindered by the number of people contributing to an effort and their ability to acquire and share knowledge.
Our development efforts generate resources for collaborative organizations, to help create and maintain communication within and among open source projects; motivate and efficiently organize groups of remote individuals, and; cultivate an open ethos where the principles and practices of open source can foster collaboration co-creation and community.

#Our Theme

####Not creating a space. But, building a home that connect the people in the networking world

#Improved communication ability through spaces:
online meetings offer a strong and effective platform for participation and communication between two or more remotely placed individuals or groups.
Online meetings have made it possible to expose the entire presentation created by the professionals to the audiences across the globe.
According to research from Lifesize, 76% of people have used video collaboration to work remotely and 75% of those found an increase in productivity and enhanced work-life balance.
Virtual communication makes it easy to stay in touch and share information with outside vendors who are often thousands of miles away. Consistent communication increases employee efficiency and productivity.

Virtual meeting etiquette ensures online meetings run smoothly. Without it, your online get-togethers will be unorganized and unproductive, attendees will have to shout over one another to be heard, and tempers will flare resulting in poor organizational culture.

#Opensource 
Open source licensing encourages innovation through collaboration.
Without it, many of the technologies we take for granted today would never have developed,
or would be locked away behind patent law. The open source movement is the reason that technology has developed
at such a breakneck pace for the past few decades.
