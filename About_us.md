### Not Creating a Space. But, Building a Home!!
Connect people to others from the comfort of their own home’.

Inspired and influenced by our learning from telephone and online platforms to enable people to connect safely with others in their neighbourhood and form lasting friendships.

Our aim is to become a network of local groups, offering a safe place for friendships, laughter and encouragement, all from the comfort and safety of your own home!
Connect the people together through Virtual Meetings and Group Chats.

Our lives are becoming more connected, and it’s a phenomenon enabled and driven by technology. How this level of connectivity affects the way we behave, live our lives and alters our lifestyles is an interesting point of debate, and one that featured at London Technology Week.

What is clear, is that technology opens up channels of communication and also gives us tools we can use to learn, which in turn gives us the skills we need to communicate effectively.

Digital learning has started to transform education at all stages of life – from school to the workplace and beyond. 

Technology transcends borders, making learning accessible to more people, regardless of time zone and study environment. With the proliferation of devices – from computers to portable smart devices – and ever-increasing connectivity more people are able to take advantage of digital learning opportunities and the chance to connect, communicate and collaborate.

Online learning and virtual learning environments are not isolating for learners, rather they open up access to high-quality content driven by well-qualified teachers and tutors.
